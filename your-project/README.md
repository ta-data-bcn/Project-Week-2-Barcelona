## Project Description
Write a short introduction to your project: 3-5 sentences about the context of your topic and why you chose it.
The local population of Barcelona are well known for taking their annual holidays during the summar month of August. During the month many businesses close - however there is an influx of visitors, who are also taking their summer break. The aim of this project is to determine if there is a change in Road Traffic Accidents (RTAs) during the month of August.

## Questions & Hypotheses

The questions to be answered during the analysis portion of this project are:
1. Does the month of year influnce the number of RTAs in Barcelona.
2. During the month of August, do accidents occur at differnet times of day compared to the rest of the year.
