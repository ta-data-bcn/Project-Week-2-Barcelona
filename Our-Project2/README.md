## Project Description
In this project, we are describing the immigration changes that happened in the city of Barcelona from the year 2015 to 2017.




## Questions & Hypotheses
What are the questions you would like to answer with your analysis? What did you feel were the answers to those questions before answering them with data?

- What are the nationalities of the immigrants who immigrate to Barcelona for the three years combined?
- What are the nationalities of the immigrants who immigrate to Barcelona for each year separately?
- What is the percentage of each of the top nationalities compared to the rest for the three years combined?
- What is the percentage of each of the top nationalities compared to the rest for each year separately?
- Is there an obvious change in any of these nationalities?
- What are the districts that immigrants usually go for?


## Dataset
What dataset (or datasets) did you use? What is the source of your data? Provide links to the data if available and describe the data briefly.

- We used the Open Data BCN website to get the data available for the years on which the analysis is performed (2015 to 2017).

Below is the link for the CSV files used for this analysis.

## Database

The database consists of only one table, so there was no Relationship Diagram needed for the analysis.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

- Had a meeting together to decide which topic to choose from.
- Each one brainstormed and researched the topic.
- Matched what we had brainstormed and the data that we found and discussed and reached the conclusion on how were we going to approach and perform the analysis.
- Divided the tasks that had to be done.
- Had another meeting to collect and make the joint analysis.

## Organization
Used Trello to keep track of the tasks done and those that were pending.

Inside the repository there is a folder for the project called "Our_Project2".
Inside "Our_Project2" folder, there are three files, the first two are jupyter notebook files for the codes that we used to import and work on the data.
The second one is a SQL file with the codes that we used to query and go through the data using mySQL.
