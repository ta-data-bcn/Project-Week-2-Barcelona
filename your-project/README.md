## Project Description
Our project consists in cleaning and analysing several DataFrames, from the Open Source provided. They are related to accidents in Barcelona and we divide the analysis in 2 main parts: Analyzing by District and Analyzin by Time.

## Questions & Hypotheses
Some of the questions we anlyzed in our project where:
- How many accidents are there by district and how does it relate to population level/percentatge?
- Do the causes differ by district?
- How many victims and vehicles are implicated in the accidents by district?
- Does the number of accidents vary by hours/shifts of the day?
- Does it vary by the day being a working day or a holiday?
- How does all this affect the level of the injuries?
- Does the stationality affect the level of the injuries?
- does the experience of the driver affect the number of accidents thei are involved with?

## Dataset
We used the ones provided by the TA's and an additional one we found in this [Link](https://www.bcn.cat/estadistica/castella/dades/inf/lecpadro/lec19/t12.htm) 
They had a lot of information on hours, days of the week and month, and several variables for location and geolocation. They also had variables for the level of the injury, the type of vehicle, the color of the vehicle and the experience of the driver.

## Workflow
We first checked the raw Dataset and tried coming up with relations we would like to explore across variables. After that we distributed the questions ans began working on separate Jupyter Notebooks, realizing that our dataset was very clean already.

We woked on the questions separately and then joined our ideas for improvement and organization, came up with the presentation and try to advise each other before each pull, commit, push, so as to not create conflicts.

## Organization
We used a Trello board, which link you will find at the bottom of this document.

Our repo is quite simple:
- datasets
- pictures
- your_project
- .gitignore
- README

Inside datasets we have all the raw and edited datasets, including the additional one.
In pictures there are all the table screencaps we used in the presentation.
In your_project we have our Notebooks with the code and the analysis.
