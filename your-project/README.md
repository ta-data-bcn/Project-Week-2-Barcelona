## Project Description

The project carries out an analysis of the Spanish general elections results in November 2019 in the city of Barcelona, in order to find out if class vote and identitary vote are a reality in the city.

We have chosen the Administration topic because we were curious to see how data could answer some of the questions as if richer areas tend to vote conservative or if there is any relationship with economical-social factors for example.





## Questions & Hypotheses
What are the questions you would like to answer with your analysis? What did you feel were the answers to those questions before answering them with data?

The main questions we have proposed are whether to consider if class voting and identitary voting are a reality in the city of Barcelona.

Some of the questions we worked to answer are:
- Relationship between the family income index and the parties voted regarding ideological and identitary factors
- Relationship between family income index and participation rate?


By the end of the project, we have been able to see that this relationship existed but not as much as we thought it was.



## Dataset
For the project we used two datasets from Open Data BCN, the Barcelona’s City Hall Open Data Service:
- [Absolute results of the General Elections of the city of Barcelona](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/est-renda-familiar): main dataset including the election results in each census section of the city, with detailed data of the elections’ votes (total, blanks, valids and nulls) and the different parties results.
- [Territorial income distribution in the city of Barcelona](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/est-eleccions-generals-seccio-censal): dataset including the family income index for each neighbourhood in Barcelona.



## Database
What is the structure of your database? Have you created more than one table and if yes, how are they related to each other? Include a drawing or computer-generated image of the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of your database.

Our database shows the elections results and family income index by the districts of the city. In order to create our database we used two tables: the first one with the absolute values of the results and the other one with the percentages.




## Workflow
1. Research about the topic
2. Find interesting questions related to our topic
3. Search for datasets that could help us answer the questions
4. Plan the database structure and data wrangling
5. Perform the analysis and conclusions
6. Prepare slides and presentation



## Organization
The project has been outlined and organized through the tool Trello. For developing the workflow of the program, pencil and paper have been used.
The repository containing the program consists of a folder that contains a Jupyter Notebook with the code of data wrangling and another Notebook with the data analysis code, a folder with the databases, a README file and a .gitignore file.
