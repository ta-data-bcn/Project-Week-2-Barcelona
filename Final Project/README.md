## Project Description
In this project we aim to explore the relationship between the rise of Covid-19 and how unemployment has behaved, through the year 2020. 


## Questions & Hypotheses

The Increase in Covid cases and restrictions has had a direct impact on unemployment in different areas of Barcelona 

## Dataset
We used one main data set, where we extracted our unemployment data from Ajuntament de Barcelona open data. 
We also accessed information from the Spanish national Statistics Institute. 


## Database
We created multiple tables to compare our results. They have been stored in the datasets/tables folder. Due to the nature of the presentation out data was transferred into Powepoint for a more concise delivery of the points ans well as a smoother presentation.


## Workflow
Mostly followed the guidelines layed out by the project, but also ended up using a Kanban board to limit our work and set deadlines.  

#### Day 1:
We chose the the topic of Economics and Business out of the provided list and we brainstormed ideas that we thought would be relevant to the topic, mostly relating shifts in the current economy as well as the impact of Covid.
We also set up our Kaban table in Trello and specified the tasks we foresaw doing on each of the days as well as tasks we saw that could come up during the duration of the project.

#### Day 2:
We narrowed down the topics we selected and settled on two hypothesis. We then took a deep dive onto the resources section as well as other databases like "Eurostat" to be able to find data to back up the expected outcomes of our hypothesis.
We also setup a working project out of which both of us could work from. This way we could put our work together without having to depend on anything other than GitHub. We created two separate folders to separate workspaces and avoid stepping on each others toes 

#### Day 3:
We pivoted slightly to show more focus on individual neighborhoods of Barcelona to make it more approachable and have a more relatable presentation 


#### Day 4: 
We made a mock presentation and a script we will follow (both documents are in the final project folder) it contained the meat and potatoes of the information since we decided to keep the presentation short and concise due to our time constraint. 

#### Day 5: 
Final presentation done, only rehearse a few times. 

## Organization

We divided up our repository to not interfere with each others work into two folders that we set up as separate work spaces. 

We set up a Kanban board in Trello which we both could use to work from and share the data we found under the respective sources. 

We decided each of us to focus on our stronger points this way we effectively maximized our skills.
