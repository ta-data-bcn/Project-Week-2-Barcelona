## Project Description
This project is an analisis of a dataset about the most frequent names in Barcelona throughout the last century.
The analisis has allowed us to answer some questions that we wouldn't have been able to answer a week ago by using what we have learned in this week's lessons.
In this project we learned how to work as a team and to ask the most insightful questions about a dataset.
We also learnd how to use MySQL to extract answers from data and be able to get interesting conclusions.
we also improved our skills on how to present a project in team.

## Questions & Hypotheses

###Questions
What are the questions you would like to answer with your analysis? What did you feel were the answers to those questions before answering them with data?
Which are the longest names in the top 50 in Barcelona?
Which are the shortest ones?
Which names are longer, male or female?
Are Andreu and Francisco Javier (our names) in the Top 50? If so, in which decade did they appear?
Which names have only appeared in just one decade? Why?
Does any name appear in the Top 50 for both genders? Which one?
Are there any names in the first decade and in the last?

###Hypotheses
How does the length of the names change through the decades? (Is it true that names have shroten throughout the decades?)
Which are the all time favourite's names? (Is it true that some names have been present in all decades?)
Which are the modern names? (Is it true that there are some names that only appear on the last 2 decades?)
Which are the top names of the century? (Is there a way to know which have been the best names of the century?
In which gender society tends to innovate more? (Is it true that society innovates more with male names?

## Dataset

This data set contain information regarding the names during each decade and it's frecuency sorted by gender.

## Workflow
First we decided which dataset were we going to analyse. Once the choice had been made the first task we did was to brainstorm about which questions would be interesting to answer.
We divided the questions into 2 types. Descriptive and analytical, we defined under which premises we were going to approach the analytical questions.
We ran all the necessary queries to answer the questions, and we proceeded to analyse the results.

## Organization
Once all the tasks were defined, we created a Trello board to decided who would do each task and how.
First we defined the question together, then we assigned each one of us half of them and we started coding.
Once we had the results, we analysed them together.
