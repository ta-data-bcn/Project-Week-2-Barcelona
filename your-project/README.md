## Project Description
Write a short introduction to your project: 

Our project was focused on investigating and answering questions regarding the population of Barcelona. 
We were given a dataset which consisted of the number of people living in each Barrio (District) of Barcelona
and their gender and age group from 2013 to 2017. We, as a team, asked questions we found interesting and sought to answer them with MySQL and Pandas!

## Questions & Hypotheses
What are the questions you would like to answer with your analysis? What did you feel were the answers to those questions before answering them with data?
Generally we wanted to ask questions with regards to how people were distributed across Barcelona in accordance to their age. Barcelona's districts
are typically known for either being family centric or party centric, so perhaps the demographic distribution might reflect that. 
Also, we were interested in wherever we could see the effects of a global aging population with the changes in demographics over time. 
We felt like those answers could definitely be obtained with the dataset. We predicted that areas such as Raval, Gotic and Born may have more party goers,
whilst areas like Sarria / Eixample might have more families. Additionally, we thought that the aging population would be reflected in the data. 

## Dataset
What dataset (or datasets) did you use? What is the source of your data? Provide links to the data if available and describe the data briefly.

We used the Population.csv. The source is from the Catalan Goverment. 

## Database
What is the structure of your database? Have you created more than one table and if yes, how are they related to each other? Include a drawing or computer-generated image of the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of your database.

Our database was based on a single CSV divided into columns that contained details regarding the District, Neighbourhoods, Gender, Number and Age Group of the entire city. 

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

Our workflow consisted of discussing the project and generating questions first handle based on a brief look at the data using MySQL Workbench.
Then, we distributed the questions into tasks for each person to complete. Once completed we met up, discussed our findings, did some more analysis and then
completed the presentation.

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?

We used the Trello board, Google Slides and Zoom conferencing to discuss and coordinate our work. 

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

The repository consists of the data files provided by Ironhack. We then divded up our SQL queries and outputs into seperate folders by branching with GitHub.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
