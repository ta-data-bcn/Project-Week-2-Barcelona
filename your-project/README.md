## Project Description


We are aware that in 2020 unemployment has raised because of the pandemic and the lockdown declared on march. We wanted to see the dimmension of this increase compared to 2019 and see if if could have affected more female than male population.

## Questions & Hypotheses
How greater is unemployment in 2020 than it was in 2019?. The raise in unemployment was related to the lockdown and the pandemic?. Has female unemployment grown more than male unemployment during 2020? 

## Dataset
We used two datasets published by the Barcelona's government on the OpenDataBCN website. Both datasets contained monthly unemployment per gender on every district of the city.

## Database

We used one database for each year. We cleaned each database to leave the variables we were interested on. We used accumulated unemployment numbers for the analysis


## Workflow
We planned our project using trello. 


## Organization
We used trello.

There is a Jupyter notebook analyzing the data for each year, we have this README file explaining the project and the two original datasets.
