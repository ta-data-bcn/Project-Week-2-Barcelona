## Project Description
This is our second project of the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp, we had to choose a subject about Barcelona. Since Mariana and I both come from South America, we decided to go into transportation, specifically into accidents in Barcelona. We know how to move around our cities and where most accidents happen but we had no idea about Barcelona, until now!

## Questions & Hypotheses
How to move around the city safely? 
Where do most accidents happen? 
Which vehicles are the most involved in these accidents? 
Which days are safer in the city? 
Do most of these accidents involve pedestrians?
Which neighborhood is the most accesible?
Which neighborhood has the most traffic of people?
Where do most people live in Barcelona?
How dangerous are the accidents in Barcelona?


## Dataset
We used data from Open Data Barcelona that is available to the public. Specifically the 2019 accidents report and the 2018 accidents report.

## Database
Our data is available as CSV files. It is in catalan for starters, had some information that we did not need and also had some missing values, so we had to clean the data we wanted and changed most of the columns and values to english. 

## Workflow
We decided on the topic and the questions we want to answer. 
Started looking for the data we needed.
Cleaned and organized the data for clearer view, discarded some of our questions.
Analyze and narrowed the data down.
Decided with which question are we going to proceed.
Made the presentation, and came up with an engaging way to present our data and answers.


## Organization
We used Trello for defining our tasks and our steps to complete this project. 
Github for our data and datasets. You will be able to find the datasets used for our presentation in the data folder, and the manipulation and cleaning of the data in our notebooks. 
We used a lot of Slack and Zoom for communication because of restrictions due to Covid-19.
