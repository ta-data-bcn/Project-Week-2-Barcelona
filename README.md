## Project Description
After reading an article on Time Out where set the district Eixample as the best one in the world, we asked what makes the difference.
Additionally, with the progressist Ada Colau in the town hall, making controversial changes in terms of mobility where the citizens are involved, our goal was to compare the different districts regarding traffic accidents, people incidents and mobility facilities as the public transport stops.

## Questions & Hypotheses
What is the difference which becomes a district better than other?
Is the district Eixample the best neighborhood to live in terms of mobility? And in terms of car accidents?

## Dataset
We have used several datasets for this work. In the first part of the work, we used datsets from all bus and metro stops in the city of Barcelona. For the second part, we used datasets from all the accidents mediated by the police of Barcelona from 2010 to 2029.

## Database
We used the database from the Barcelona town hall (opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat)

## Workflow
First we decided the topic based on the option we had from class. Once we decided it, we start searching in the different databases until we found some datasets that looked interesting to us. After that, we started to import and analyse the data in general until we decided which important insights could be taken from them.
We cleaned the data and perform some mathematical calculations. Then, we compared our results and discuss about them. Finally, we got the answers for our questions and prepared the presentation of the work.

## Organization
We used Trello to plan the days until the presentation day. We split the work in two parts in order to work independiently but coordinately. We were working mostly physically together and we exchange information through Slack and GitHub.

Our repository is composed by a folder with the datasets and a file of python code.
